# Research Gaps and Future Studies for Chirp
## Academic Research Agenda

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
While Chirp is built on established therapeutic frameworks, significant research is needed to validate its efficacy, understand mechanisms of change, and optimize implementation. This document outlines critical research gaps and proposes a comprehensive research agenda.

## 1. IMMEDIATE RESEARCH NEEDS

### 1.1 Efficacy Validation

#### Gap: No Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness
**Current State**: Platform is theoretically grounded but lacks empirical validation
**Needed Research**:
- Randomized controlled trial comparing Chirp to:
  - Traditional in-person social skills training
  - Other digital interventions
  - Waitlist control
- Minimum sample size: n=120 (power analysis for medium effect size)
- Duration: 12-week intervention with 6-month follow-up

#### Gap: Unknown Optimal Dosage
**Questions**:
- How many sessions per week are optimal?
- What is the minimum effective duration?
- Is there a plateau effect?
**Proposed Study**: Dose-response study with 4 arms (1x, 2x, 3x, 5x per week)

### 1.2 Mechanism of Change

#### Gap: Unclear Active Ingredients
**Research Questions**:
- Is it the AI adaptation that drives improvement?
- Role of gamification vs. therapeutic content?
- Importance of bird character relationships?
**Methodology**: Component analysis study with factorial design

#### Gap: Transfer to Real-World Settings
**Critical Question**: Do skills learned in Chirp generalize to:
- School settings
- Home interactions
- Peer relationships
- Novel situations
**Proposed Measurement**: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with parent/teacher reports
